# SwiftCentrifuge

SwiftCentrifuge is a Websocket client for Centrifugo and Centrifuge library. This client uses Protobuf protocol for client-server communication.

SwiftCentrifuge runs all operations in its own queues and provides necessary callbacks so you don't need to worry about managing concurrency yourself.

## Status of library

This library is feature rich and supports almost all available Centrifuge/Centrifugo features (see matrix below). But it's very young and not tested in production application yet. Any help and feedback is very appreciated to make it production ready and update library status. Any report will give us an understanding that the library works, is useful and we should continue developing it. Please share your stories.

## Installation

There are several convenient ways.

### CocoaPods

To integrate SwiftCentrifuge into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SwiftCentrifuge'
```

### Carthage

Add the line `github "centrifugal/centrifuge-swift"` to your `Cartfile`. Then run `carthage update`.

### Swift Package Manager

SwiftCentrifuge is compatible with SPM. If you get a warning complaining about missing pc file, you may need to install `pkg-config`. On macOS, this can be achieved with `brew install pkg-config`.

### Manual

Clone the repo and drag files from `Sources` folder into your Xcode project.

## Dependencies

This library depends on two libraries:

- [SwiftProtobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)
- [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream)

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0
- Xcode 10.0

## Getting Started

An [example app](Demo) is included demonstrating basic client functionality.

### Basic usage

Connect to server based on Centrifuge library:

```swift
import SwiftCentrifuge

class ClientDelegate : NSObject, CentrifugeClientDelegate {
    func onConnect(_ client: CentrifugeClient, _ e: CentrifugeConnectEvent) {
        print("connected with id", e.client)
    }
    func onDisconnect(_ client: CentrifugeClient, _ e: CentrifugeDisconnectEvent) {
        print("disconnected", e.reason, "reconnect", e.reconnect)
    }
}

let config = CentrifugeClientConfig()
let url = "ws://127.0.0.1:8000/connection/websocket?format=protobuf"
let client = CentrifugeClient(url: url, config: config, delegate: ClientDelegate())
client.connect()
```

Note that *you must use* `?format=protobuf` in connection URL as this client communicates with Centrifugo/Centrifuge over Protobuf protocol.

To connect to Centrifugo you need to additionally set connection JWT:

```swift
...
let client = CentrifugeClient(url: url, config: config, delegate: ClientDelegate())
client.setToken("YOUR CONNECTION JWT")
client.connect()
```

Now let's look at how to subscribe to channel and listen to messages published into it:

```swift
import SwiftCentrifuge

class ClientDelegate : NSObject, CentrifugeClientDelegate {
    func onConnect(_ client: CentrifugeClient, _ e: CentrifugeConnectEvent) {
        print("connected with id", e.client)
    }
    func onDisconnect(_ client: CentrifugeClient, _ e: CentrifugeDisconnectEvent) {
        print("disconnected", e.reason, "reconnect", e.reconnect)
    }
}

class SubscriptionDelegate : NSObject, CentrifugeClientDelegate {
    func onPublish(_ s: CentrifugeSubscription, _ e: CentrifugePublishEvent) {
        let data = String(data: e.data, encoding: .utf8) ?? ""
        print("message from channel", s.channel, data)
    }
}

let config = CentrifugeClientConfig()
let url = "ws://127.0.0.1:8000/connection/websocket?format=protobuf"
let client = CentrifugeClient(url: url, config: config, delegate: ClientDelegate())
client.connect()

do {
    let sub = try client.newSubscription(channel: "example", delegate: SubscriptionDelegate())
    sub.subscribe()
} catch {
    print("Can not create subscription: \(error)")
}
```
